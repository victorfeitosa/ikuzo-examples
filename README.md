# Ikuzo - Benchmarks and Examples
This repository includes examples for the PSN00b SDK and the Ikuzo framework(future work), along with a few benchmarks to measure performance and usability of certain features

## PSN00b SDK
The PSN00b SDK is a library originally created by Lameguy64 and maintained by SpicyJPEG which aims to provide an open source alternative to Sony's PSYQ SDK for the original Playstation. The library implements most of the PSYQ's features and replicates it's API very closely. It also adds a few new features and supports modern compilers.

### PSN00b Examples
#### FPS Independent movement
An FPS independent movement implementation based on timers.

### PSN00b Benchmarks
#### Quads vs Triangles
A benchmark that shows the difference in performance between rendering multiple quad primitives vs triangle primitives.


## Ikuzo Framework
(future work)
